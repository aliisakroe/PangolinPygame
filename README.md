# PangolinPygame

This is a frogger style game, using moving snake sprites that the user cannot touch as he moves his pangolin sprite up the game board. The user's pangolin sprite is controlled using arrow keys. A red screen means that a snake sprite has bitten the pangolin! There is only one level to this game.
